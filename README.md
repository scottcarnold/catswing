# CatSwing
Reusable classes and tools for Java Swing.

This is a revamped collection of classes providing reusable panels and dialogs, file management, logging tools, cross-platform features, and animation effects.  While targeted for use with certain other Swing applications, they are generic in nature and could be used for any number of Swing applications.
