Reusable classes and tools for Java Swing.

This is a revamped collection of classes from years ago when Swing was more common and I was writing Swing applications for myself as a hobby.  These are generic in nature and could be used for any number of Swing applications, but were primarily used for my CatBack and CatScan applications which I also intend to revamp and add to my collection of repositories.
